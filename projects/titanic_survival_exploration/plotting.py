# In this exercise we'll examine a learner which has high variance, and tries to learn
# nonexistant patterns in the data.
# Use the learning curve function from sklearn.learning_curve to plot learning curves
# of both training and testing error. Use plt.plot() within the plot_curve function
# to create line graphs of the values.
